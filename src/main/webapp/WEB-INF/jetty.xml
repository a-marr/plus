	<!--  This file is an ugly work-around hack.  
	Jetty starts up very slowly because it tries to scan every class within every JAR in a web app.
	Because PLUS contains many such jars....that's bad.
	For a full explanation, see: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Avoid_slow_deployment
	
	Basically this is a useless pattern designed to match only a few things that have relevant annotations.
	The main point of the pattern is to *not* match every single JAR plus comes with.
