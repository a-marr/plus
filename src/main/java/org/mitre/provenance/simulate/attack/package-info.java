/**
 * This package contains classes suitable for mimicking or demonstrating the effects of various forms of attacks on derived
 * provenance graphs.  This is experimental and meant for simulation only.
 * 
 * <p>The core idea here is that various forms of infrastructure attacks performed on large
 * distributed applications will have the effect of changing what provenance is logged, in an 
 * environment where provenance capture is instrumented.   This code helps demonstrate the 
 * hypothesis of what these changes will look like.
